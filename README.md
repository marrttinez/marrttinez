# 👋 Hi, I'm Richard!

I'm a **junior developer** currently in training.  
My work mainly involves **analyzing and debugging** existing systems, even though I wasn't the original developer. However, I'm now taking the next step: **starting to build my own projects**.

I'm a **self-taught learner**, constantly improving through courses, documentation, and hands-on practice.  
This GitHub profile is where I’ll be documenting my journey — sharing personal projects, experiments, and everything I'm learning on my path to becoming a **professional developer**.

## 🚀 Technologies I'm exploring
- 🐍 Python & Django  
- 🗃️ PostgreSQL
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- 🧠 Git, GitHub, Bash

## 🎯 Currently working on
- Learning Django through real mini-projects  
- Strengthening database knowledge (PostgreSQL & SQL)  
- Creating useful tools to solve everyday tech problems

## 📚 Goals for 2025
- ✅ Create and publish at least 3 personal projects
- 🚧 Contribute to an open-source project
- 📖 Continue learning React or Vue for frontend
