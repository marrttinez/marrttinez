# Hi, I'm Richard!
I'm a junior developer currently in training. Right now, my work involves analyzing and debugging existing systems, even though I wasn't the one who developed them. But now, I'm taking the next step—starting to build my own projects.

I'm a self-taught learner, constantly improving through courses, documentation, and hands-on practice. This GitHub profile is where I’ll be documenting my journey, sharing personal projects, and showing everything I'm learning on my path to becoming a professional developer.

I’m especially interested in Python, Django, and databases like PostgreSQL, but I’m also open to learning new technologies and tackling new challenges.
